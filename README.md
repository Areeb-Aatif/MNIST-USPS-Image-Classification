# MNIST-USPS-Image-Classification

Given a set of digit images, we model 4 different classifiers known as multiclass logistic regression, neural netwroks, random forests and support vector machine (SVM). After defining these classifiers, we train these models on MNIST dataset. Later we tune the hyper-parameters to get better accuracy. 

Finally we ensemble all the different classifiers by using majority voting.
